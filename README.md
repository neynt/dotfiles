These are the configuration files that make my setup work. It's rather badly organized, but you might be able to pull something out of it.

## Software used

* awesome
    * eminent (hides unused tags)
* firefox
* thunar
* xfce4-terminal
* xfsettingsd
* compton

## Currently used files

* awesome/
* bin/ - scripts
* icons/ - application-specific system tray icons
* vim/
* FlatStudio-Mine/ - modified from FlatStudioGray (thinner scrollbars, less thickness, less gradients).
* Acrylic-Icons/ - basically, I started with AnyColorYouLike, and am slowly replacing the icons with my own.

## Old files

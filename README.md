Neynt's dotfiles
================

These are the configuration files that make my Arch Linux setup work.

* awesome/ - a bunch of lua that makes awesome work.

* Zukitwo-Mine/ - the excellent Zukitwo gtk theme with a few of my own modifications.

* icons/ - pesky application-specific system tray icons that need to be overwritten
